        6 Certified Lipsologists worldwide and the only one on the east coast trained
        in the entertaining practice of Lipsology! What is Lipsology? It is the new
        and exciting art and science of Lip Print Reading - i.e. discovering
        personality characteristics, energy levels, emotions and what is currently
        happening for her clients through the interpretation of their lip prints.
        Interpretation is based on lip-print chargarcteristics such as size, shape,
        color intensity or lack of color, fullness, positioning and special markings.
        The lip prints are made by people putting on lipstick and then kissing or
        pressing their lips to paper or Arianas kiss cards. Yes, guys do this too!
        Ariana also does couples readings so you bring the lips and Ariana will bring
        the lipstick. At corporate or private parties Ariana uses Lipsology to
        discover what your guests lip prints have to say about them. Her unique
        upbeat style and lighthearted approach set a playful and fun tone for your
        guests. This entertainment is amazing and fun and something you and your
        guests will never forget.
