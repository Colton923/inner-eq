        <p className={styles.missionText}>
          A Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes

          idea that an unseen “life force energy” flows through us and is what causes
          us to be alive. If one’s “life force energy” is low, then we are more
          likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable
          of being happy and healthy. Reiki treats the whole person including body,
          emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include
          relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing.
